title: How do I use the plugin?
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

> Note: I have assumed that you will already be using ECharts when reading this section. so if there is something you feel you don't understand in reading it, please go [[catch up|https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html]]. Feel free to contribute to this tutorial as well, I know I didn't write it too well.

This plugin can be used in a very simple or complex way, let's start with the simplest way.

Define an "echarts" widget.

```html
<$echarts />
```

Like other widgets, the `echarts` widget has a number of attributes.

|!Attribute |!Description |
|$text |A piece of js code that can generate charts directly |
|$tiddler |Tiddler containing configuration information (the title), either JSON type, JS type or TW5 type. If the `$text` parameter is present, it has no effect |
|$width |The width of the canvas, default is `100%` |
|$height |Height of the canvas, default is `300px` |
|$class |Class name of the outer `div` container of the canvas, default is `gk0wk-echarts-body` |
|$fillSidebar |Whether to automatically adjust the height to fill the sidebar when the wdiget is in the sidebar, default is `true` |
|$theme |ECharts theme, `light` for bright theme, `dark` for dark theme, `auto` (default) for automatic judgment |
|$renderer |Rendering method, `canvas` (default) or `svg` |
|$throttle | Integer, in milliseconds, used to control the refresh rate, used to prevent the browser from lagging due to too frequent refreshes, default is `1000` |
|Others |If `$tiddler` points to an tiddler of type JS, it will be used as an argument to its `onUpdate` function |

!! <$text text="$text"/>: The most beginner-friendly way

After all, there are only a few people who can write JavaScript, and I guess a lot of people got started by copying and modifying the official ECharts sample code - it's okay that I did the same thing at first! :D

So I've prepared a very simple way to use it for you. Copy the code from any of the [[official ECharts examples|https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/]], use it as an argument to `$text`, and you're done.

For example, if we want to use the [[graph here|https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=line-sections]], then we put its code (note: the contents of the `Edit Code` and not the contents of the `Full Code`) into the `$text` parameter.

```html
<$echarts $text="""
option = {
... (Content is too long so omitted)
"""/>
```

Or you can store it in a tiddler, such as [[ExampleOfTextData]], and take its value by `transclude`:

```html
<$echarts $text={{ExampleOfTextData}}/>
```

The following can then be achieved:

<$echarts $text={{ExampleOfTextData}}/>

I have also prepared the macro form, so the following is also possible:

```html
<<echarts """
option = ...
""">>
```

macro also has optional parameters such as `width`, so we won't go into them here.

!! JSON type tiddlers

The difficult thing to understand here is what does `$tiddler` point to? Here is a small example, take a look at [[$:/plugins/Gk0Wk/echarts/addons/SimpleExample.json]], you can find it is a JSON file, guys who have used ECharts should be able to see what it is at a glance, yes, it is the first attribute of `echarts.setOption` function.

We import this bar chart as follows, and it will be displayed.

```html
<$echarts $tiddler="$:/plugins/Gk0Wk/echarts/addons/SimpleExample.json"/>
```

Or:

```html
<<echarts "$:/plugins/Gk0Wk/echarts/addons/SimpleExample.json">>
```

<$echarts $tiddler="$:/plugins/Gk0Wk/echarts/addons/SimpleExample.json"/>

Is it that simple? Yes, it's really that simple. You don't have to worry about the rest, including automatic canvas resizing, refresh mechanism, resource management, etc.

!! TW5 type tiddlers

However, a static JSON file is not useful for anything other than demonstrating static information. I believe what you need more is an tiddler that can be dynamically updated. To meet such a need, if `$tiddler` points to a normal tiddler (of type empty or `text/vnd.tiddlywiki`, called TW5 tiddler below), then it will be rendered to get the plain text content, which will then be parsed as JSON. This allows conditional rendering and data traversal using widgets such as `<$list>` and `<$reveal>`.

A very good example here (even worthy of an excellent plugin) is the dynamic count of the size of all installed plugins, presented as a matrix tree diagram. Each block is expandable and scalable.

<$echarts $tiddler="$:/plugins/Gk0Wk/echarts/addons/PluginsSize" $height="500px"/>

The corresponding tiddler is [[$:/plugins/Gk0Wk/echarts/addons/PluginsSize]], which will generate a very long tiddler, so be prepared for a lag when opening it.

But having said that, you may wonder at what point the widget will be refreshed? By default, for JSON tiddlers and TW5 tiddlers, they are updated only when the widget attributes are changed or when the tiddler pointed to by `$tiddler` changes.

So can I decide the timing of the refresh myself? Sure, just add the `echarts-refresh-trigger` field to the tiddler pointed to by `$tiddler`. This field should be filled with your custom filter expression and will trigger an update whenever the result of the expression changes. For example, `[[Examples]get[modified]]` will make the updating when the ''Examples'' tiddler is modified (because the timestamp will change).

[[clsturgeon|https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/t/echarts-bringing-amazing-visualization-tools-to-tiddlywiki/1944/32?u=sttot]] proposed a requirement that an addon of type TW5 should be able to get the variables of the tiddler that is using the echarts widget (e.g. get the `currentTiddler` of the tiddler using the echarts widget in order to access itsfields). To achieve this, you can add custom properties to the echarts widget, which can then be used as variables in the corresponding TW5 type addon. For example:

```html
<$echarts $tiddler="xxx" outterTiddler=<<currentTiddler>>/>
```

This variable can then be used in an addon of type TW5:

```html
`{
	"value": "`<$text text=<<outterTiddler>>/>`"
}`
```

!! JS type tiddlers

Using TW5 syntax to generate data should definitely still have limitations. If you want the maximize flexibility, it is recommended to write in ~JavaScript (of course, there is definitely a technical threshold).

Regardless of JSON, TW5 or JS, the core thing is definitely to generate an object that `setOption` can support. But for JS type tiddlers, the advantage is having a lifecycle, having state, custom update timing and full control over the `echarts` instance - of course, I've taken care of the hassle for you, you just need to focus on the visualization itself.

I took a page from Vue and React to write the component, and the template for a JS type tiddler looks like this:

```javascript
/**
 * Function to be called when the component is first initialized (optional)
 * @param {ECharts} myChart echarts instance, see the echarts API documentation for details
 * @param {AttributesType} addonAttributes An object contains all attribute passed in by the <$echarts> widget
 * @param {EChartsWidget} echartsWidget The <$echarts> widget instance
 * @return {StateType} Initialized component state for state management (optional)
 */
exports.onMount = function (myChart, addonAttributes, echartsWidget) {
  return {};
};
/**
 * Determine if the formation needs to be refreshed (optional)
 * @param {StateType} state The state of the component, which is the one returned by onMount
 * @param {IChangedTiddlers} changedTiddlers The refresh is triggered by the TW system listening for a change in the tiddler, which is an array of strings containing the titles of all changed tiddlers
 * @param {Record<string, true>} Which parameters have been changed, including those beginning with $
 * @return {boolean} boolean Returns true if a refresh is required, and vice versa
 *
 * shouldRefresh It can also be a string, which would be the same as the echarts-refresh-trigger field
 */
exports.shouldUpdate = function (state, changedTiddlers) {
  return true;
}
/**
 * Functions to be called when a component is updated
 * @param {ECharts}myChart echarts instance, see the echarts API documentation for details
 * @param {StateType} state An object contains all attribute passed in by the <$echarts> widget
 * @param {AttributesType} addonAttributes <$echarts> An object contains all attribute passed in by the <$echarts> widget
 */
exports.onUpdate = function (myChart, state, addonAttributes) {
  // Note: The function does not return any value, you need to call the setOption function manually
  // The required attribute are available, feel free to do whatever you want
  myChart.setOption({});
}
/**
 * Function to be called when the component is unloaded (optional)
 * Note: If the browser page is closed directly, it may not be possible to call this function
 * @param {StateType} state An object contains all attribute passed in by the <$echarts> widget
 */
exports.onUnmount = function (state) {

}
```

@@color:red;Note: This tiddler should be of type `application/javascript` and should contain the field `module-type` with the value `echarts-component`. @@

Here is also a simple example for generating a tag word cloud of all non-system tiddlers ([[$:/plugins/Gk0Wk/echarts/addons/TagCloud.ts]]):

<$echarts $tiddler="$:/plugins/Gk0Wk/echarts/addons/TagCloud.js"/>

Here I want to briefly explain why there are `addonAttributes` and how they should be used. If you have the ability to write JS type visual components, hopefully you will be able to develop components not just for yourself but for others as well, and I've set aside enough places for you to be able to expand on the `<$echarts>` component so that when the user enters custom parameters like `<$echarts foo="bar"/>`, you will be able to get them as well, which has more flexibility. I hope this helps you write more flexible and versatile components!
